# Backend 

 You need to build a desktop web application for keeping notes. You can draw inspiration from Google Keep. Here are the features that you need to build:
   - User Authentication and content sync
   - Menu Features to contain
       * Create a new note
       * Search in your notes
       * Special view - Label View [all tagged notes with that label]
       * Archived Notes
   - One note can have multiple tags [up to 9 tags]
   - You should be able to toggle between background colors for the note
   - Trash Notes - Deleted notes in the last 30 days
   
 ## Frameworks & Constraints
   - Use NodeJS for backend APIs and setup user authentication & user profile. 
   - We want you to build the frontend application without the use of any frontend framework. 
   - You are allowed to use jQuery if you wish. 
   - For backend, You can use NodeJS or any other JS backend framework.
